            The residence where the spouses live as long as the marriage
            continues is called the family residence. <br /> The family
            residence annotation is a regulation that prevents one spouse from
            selling or renting the <br /> residence without the permission of
            the other. The family residence annotation, which is made by adding{" "}
            <br /> an annotation to the title deed, is a legal practice that
            aims to protect the rights of the spouses by <br /> restricting
